## Questions
+ IDE vs editors
	+ The boundary between an IDE and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined
	- **Complexity**: IDEs are feature-rich and heavier, while editors are lightweight and faster.
	- **Built-in Tools**: IDEs come with many tools integrated; editors rely on external plugins.
	- **Resource Usage**: IDEs tend to use more memory and processing power; editors are less resource-intensive.
	- **Setup Time**: IDEs can have a steeper learning curve, while editors are often easier to set up and use.
	- IDEs are all-in-one environments for heavy development, while editors are faster and simpler tools, often extended through plugins.
+ is VS code an IDE?
	+ VS code is not an IDE because it doesn’t come with the features of an IDE. It’s just a text editor. But it has a lot of third-party extensions which make VS code “almost” capable of what an IDE does. So the difference between VScode and an IDE is very slim now
